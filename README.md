## About this project
The objective of this package is to offer very simple modules for projects using python 3.
At the same time that I learn more about the language itself and grow my own personal projects 
I will increase, over time, the functionalities of the package and it's modules.

### Modules
- read_write_json:
  - as the name and the description above suggests, this package seeks to offer very simple
  implementations of read and write operations of or to json files. Like I mentioned above,
  as I learn more about the language and as I develop my own projects even more, I will 
  increase the features offered.
